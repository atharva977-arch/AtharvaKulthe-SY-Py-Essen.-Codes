#A nutrition app needs to calculate daily caloric intake. Write a Python script that:
#Defines a function calculate_calories(carbs, fats, proteins) that calculates total
#calories based on grams of carbs, fats, and proteins (1 gram of carbs = 4 calories, 1
#gram of fats = 9 calories, 1 gram of proteins = 4 calories).
#Uses this function to input the grams of carbs, fats, and proteins consumed in a day and
#prints the total caloric intake.

def calculate_calories():
	carbs = float(input("Enter grams of carbs intake: "))
	fats = float(input("Enter grams of fats intake: "))
	proteins = float(input("Enter grams of protein intake: "))
	total_calories = (carbs * 4) + (fats * 9) + (proteins * 4)
	print("    ")
	print("-------------Daily Caloric Intake-------------")
	print("The total calories consumed in a day is", total_calories)
calculate_calories()
